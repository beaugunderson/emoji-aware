## emoji-aware

Emoji-aware unicode string utilities for JavaScript.

You'll need these if you ever want to split strings that contain emoji.

If you use naive methods for this (or packages that purport to split unicode
strings correctly) you'll have trouble because emoji can span multiple
characters/surrogate pairs.

The longest emoji I'm aware of is specified by 4 "regular" emoji (one, a heart,
with its own variation selector) with zero-width joiners in between them.
That's 8 unicode characters as split by most libraries. This library will
correctly split that emoji into one entry in the returned array of characters.

(But the unicode portion probably needs
[some more work](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode)).

### Example

```js
var split = require('emoji-aware').split;

var result = split('cats 😸 are the best');

result[5] === '😸';
// true
```

A starker example that uses Mathias Bynens' `getSymbols` with a
[composed emoji](http://i.imgur.com/NUKsA1Y.png):
